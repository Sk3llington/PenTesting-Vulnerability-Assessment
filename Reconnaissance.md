To perform the following reconnaissance demonstration, I will use IBM's "Altoro Mutual" located at `demo.testfire.net`. This website was designed by IBM to detect web application vulnerabilities.

I will use widely available open-source tools to perform all reconnaissance tasks.


## Google Dorking


The amount of information freely available on the open internet is astonishing. In this section I will use Google to gather important data about Altoro Mutual and will go over how this data can we weaponized by malicious actors.

Altoro Mutual's website does not display the name of their executive members. The company wants to ensure that private information about their executive and upper management team is not accessible on their public website. 

By simply searching for “altoro mutual ceo” in the google search bar, I was able to quickly find the name of the CEO, Karl Fitzgerald. But more alarming is the fact that I was able to quickly find the following web page: http://www.altoromutual.com/index.jsp?content=inside_executives.htm (screenshot below).

Since Altoro Mutual wants to ensure that private information is not accessible on their public website, the previous webpage is definitely an issue for the company as it lists the entire C-Suite and upper management teams.

### How can this information be helpful to an attacker:
 
- An attacker with the list of the C suite and/or upper management can start to use the names to start a social engineering attack on other employees of the company.
- An attacker can use the names to do more research and figure out the emails of the C suite team and start a Spear Phishing campaign targeting them.
- An attacker can Spoof the CEO or CFO and initiate unauthorized money wire transfer for example. This type of attack falls into the BEC schemes (Business Email Compromise).
- Other attacks on the C Suite team can include impersonating one of the C Suite members to gain access to sensitive information, grant access to a fake employee, transfer confidential data etc.


## DNS and Domain Discovery
 
In this section I used Domain Dossier which is a tool that generates reports from public records about domain names and IP addresses.

Next I entered the IP address for `demo.testfire.net` into Domain Dossier to gather the following information about the company:
 
 
1. Location of the company: 
 
From the Domain WHOIS record:
 
The company is located in Sunnyvale, California 94085, USA.
 
2. NetRange IP address:
 
65.61.137.64 - 65.61.137.127
 
CIDR: 65.61.137.64/26 
 
3. What is the company they use to store their infrastructure:
 
Rackspace Backbone Engineering
  
4. What is the IP address of the DNS server:
 
65.61.137.117
