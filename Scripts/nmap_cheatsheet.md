### Syn Scan

```bash
nmap -sS
```

### UDP Scan

```bash
nmap -sU
```

### OS detection

```bash
nmap -O
```

### Services running

```bash
nmap -sV
```

### Verbose

```bash
nmap -V
```

### Verbose level 2

```bash
nmap -vV
```

### save result in 3 major formats

```bash
nmap -oA
```

### Output scan in normal, XML, s|<rIpt kIddi3, and Grepable format


-oN <file>
-oX <file>
-oS <file>
-oG <file> 

### Aggressive mode (activate service detection, OS detection, script scanning and traceroute)

```bash  
nmap -A
```
  
### Scan speed (paranoid, sneaky, polite, normal, aggressive, insane)
 
```bash  
nmap -T1-5
```
  
### Scan specific port(s)

```bash
nmap -p <port>
```
  
### Scan port range

ex:

```bash
nmap -p 1000-1500
```
  
### scan all ports

```bash
nmap -p-
```
  
### Activate scripts

```bash  
nmap --script <script>
```
### Active all scripts in the Vuln category

```bash  
nmap --script=vuln
```
  
### Command to identify all ip addresses of a network and save the output to a file.

```bash
nmap -sn 0.0.0.0/24 | awk '/Nmap scan/{gsub(/[()]/,"",$NF); print $NF > "nmap_scanned_ips"}'
```

  
### Get detailed list of hosts that Nmap will scan without scanning them

```bash  
nmap -sL <ip address>
```


### Using `ICMP Echo` request to discover live hosts (added -sn to not follow with port scan). If you get MAC addresses in the echo replies, it means that the hosts are on the same subnet.
  
```bash
nmap -PE -sn machine_ip/24
```
  
### If firewall is blocking `ICMP Type 8 Echo` requests, we can try 2 different scans, `ICMP Timestamp` or `ICMP Address Mask` requests to tell if a system is online:
  

ICMP Timestamp:
  
```bash
nmap -PP -sn machine_ip/24
```
  
ICMP Address Mask requests:

```bash
nmap -PM -sn machine_ip/24
```
  
Since we don't know which ICMP packet is blocked by the host firewall, it's important to try different scans in order to properly map the target network.
