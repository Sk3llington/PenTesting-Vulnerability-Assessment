### Find files based on filename:

```bash
find [directory path] -type f -name [filename]
```

### Find Directory based on directory name:

```bash
find [directory path] -type d -name [filename]
```

### Find files based on size:

```bash
find [directory path] -type f -size [size]
```

#### **Example:**

> find /home/Andy -type f -size 10c

> c for bytes,

> k for kilobytes

> M megabytes

> G for gigabytes



### Find files based on username 

```bash
find [directory path] -type f -user [username]
```

### Find files based on group name 

```bash
find [directory path] -type f -group [group name]
```

### Find files modified after a specific date

```bash
find [directory path] -type f -newermt '[date and time]'
```

#### **Example:**

> find / -type f -newermt '6/30/2020 0:00:00'

> (all dates/times after 6/30/2020 0:00:00 will be considered a condition to look for)

### Find files based on date modified 

```bash
find [directory path] -type f -newermt [start date range] ! -newermt [end date range]
```

#### **Example:**

> find / -type f -newermt 2013-09-12 ! -newermt 2013-09-14

> (all dates before 2013-09-12 will be excluded; all dates after 2013-09-14 will be excluded, therefore this only leaves 2013-09-13 as the date to look for.)

### Find files based on date accessed

```bash
find [directory path] -type f -newerat [start date range] ! -newerat [end date range]
```

#### **Example:**

> find / -type f -newerat 2017-09-12 ! -newerat 2017-09-14

> (all dates before 2017-09-12 will be excluded; all dates after 2017-09-14 will be excluded, therefore this only leaves 2017-09-13 as the date to look for.)

### Find files with a specific keyword

```bash
grep -iRl [directory path/keyword]
```
