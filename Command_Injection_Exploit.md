# Web Application Vulnerability Assessment

## Command Injection

For this vulnerability assessment we are going to use a DVWA instance, the "Damn Vulnerable Web Application".


Command used to display “/etc/passwd”:

```bash
8.8.8.8 && ls; cat ../../../../../etc/passwd
```


Result:

![dvwa command injection](https://github.com/Sk3llington/PenTesting-Vulnerability-Assessment/blob/main/images/etc_passwd_command_injection_successful.png)


Command to display “/etc/hosts”

```bash
8.8.8.8 && ls; cat ../../../../../etc/hosts
```

Mitigation:

There are several practices that can be implemented to prevent command injections, below a few of them:

- Set up input validation, where arguments with “;”, “&&”, “|” and “..” or “../” are banned.
- Create a white list of possible inputs to make sure that the system will accept only predefined inputs. For example, if an input field requires users to type in a day of the   week, only the 7 days of the week can be accepted as an input for this specific field.
- Use only secure APIs. For example with Java, instead of using Runtime.exec() to issue a mail command, it’s safer to use the available API located at javax.mail. Instead of     running a process that has the power to control many more processes and can be leveraged to run other commands than what it was intended for in the first place, an API will    have a narrower function, and will be called to accomplish a certain task tied to a microservice most of the time.
